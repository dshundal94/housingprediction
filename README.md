Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Housing Prices in Lodi
I'm looking at houses that were recently sold in the Lodi area (95240 and 95242) and using different machine learning algorithms to
predict housing prices on houses that are currently in the market. I'm a licensed real estate agent and have access to MetroList, so
that's where I'm getting my data from. So far, I've tried to predict prices using Random Forests, Decision Tree Regression,  Gradient Boosted Regression, Linear Regression,
and Neural Networks. Gradient Boosted Regression and Random Forest work the best with the training data, with neural networks and linear regression performing well, but not as
strongly as the others.
