Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Housing Prices in Lodi
I'm looking at houses that were recently sold in the Lodi area (95240 and 95242) and using different machine learning algorithms to
predict housing prices on houses that are currently in the market. I'm a licensed real estate agent and have access to MetroList, so
that's where I'm getting my data from. So far, I've tried to predict prices using Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression,
and Naive Bayes. I realize that Naive Bayes is used for classification, but I just wanted to see if I could implement it. I will gather
more data and try different algorithms, maybe boosted algorithms to see if I can a better prediction overall. Stay tuned!
